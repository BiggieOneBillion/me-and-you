# Me and You

This project is a chat application that uses socket.io for real time communication.
I wanted to learn about using socket.io for real-time communication and i thought of it and since project based learning is the way to go i decide to get my hands dirty and build a chat app.

I used react.js for the front end and node js for the backend.

The backend is used to store the messages between the users and also keep track of the users using the platform. 

I implemented features like one-to-one chat, chat rooms, creation of chat room,  notifications, sending invites to users before you can chat with them e.t.c and i am still adding more.
